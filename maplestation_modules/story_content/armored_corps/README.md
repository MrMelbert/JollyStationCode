This folder is for overrides to names and descriptions which follow the Armored Corps lore of Maplestation, rather than regular "common" lore. Therefore, the modular code utilizes the common lore for easy porting to other codebases, but this folder has all the unique flair for the server.

Also use this folder for any Armored Corps content like uniforms and such.
