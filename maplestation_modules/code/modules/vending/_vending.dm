	 * All without touching the vending machines directly
	 *
	 * * Having an added category matching the name of an existing category will combine the categories,
	 * meaning products defined here will be added to the category. This works with subctraction, if you want to remove
	 * an item from a certain category entirely.
	 *
	 * * Having an added category with items already present in the generic products list will remove them
	 * and have them be in your category instead
	 *
	 * * Otherwise, categories here will just be added to the categories like normal.

	Here's a template for adding and removing items.

	An item not already in the list will be added with the value you set.
	An item already in the list will have it's amount adjusted by the value you set.
	If you set a negative value, it will remove items from an existing item.

	If an item's amount is below 0 after adjusting it, it will be removed from the list entirely.
	Use -99 if you want an item to be guaranteed removed from the list.
